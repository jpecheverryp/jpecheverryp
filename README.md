# Hey there!
I am a Javascript developer curious about both frontend and backend technologies.

I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology Coding Bootcamp, where I learned how to develop websites using different technologies, such as the MERN stack.

I am actively looking for a frontend, backend or full-stack position developing mainly with JavaScript or TypeScript.

I am looking for job opportunities in software development.

I am fluent with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+
- React.js
- Next.js
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express
- Rest APIs
- SQL
- NoSQL (MongoDB)

I have also tried other technologies such as:
- TailwindCSS
- ChakraUI
- Python
- JWT

I am also interested in learning new technologies such as Go (Programming language), and Neovim (Terminal based Text Editor)
